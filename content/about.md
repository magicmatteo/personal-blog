Hi! I'm Matt, and this is my blog, where I intend to write about anything and everything I learn or find interesting throughout my tech journey. My general curiosity has funnelled me closer and closer to the coal face of technology. My background is in networking & systems administration with a current heavy focus on cloud, automation and software development.
